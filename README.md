# carColorClassification
n today’s world, precise vehicle classification has become indispensable across
diverse sectors, ranging from security systems in commercial establishments and hospitality
venues to advanced parking facilities, autonomous driving technologies and comprehensive
traffic analysis. Among the most important elements of vehicle identification is determining
the dominant color. A vehicle’s color is often the most immediately noticeable feature, playing
a key role in enhancing public safety, streamlining access control mechanisms, and accumulat-
ing invaluable data essential for traffic management and urban planning initiatives. This study
presents a comparative analysis of diverse methodologies for determining vehicular color. Our
primary objective is to evaluate the efficacity of traditional approaches specifically color his-
togram extraction coupled with euclidean distance classification against cutting edge deep
learning techniques employing YOLO-World and state of the art Large Multimodal Models
(LMMs). Our methodological framework involved implementing these varied approaches on a
uniform dataset, comprising images of automobiles categorized by color. The findings reveal
that while conventional computer vision methods yield dependable results, fine-tuned CLIP
models demonstrate superior precision and robustness, particularly when confronted with
challenging scenarios such as variable lighting conditions and partial occlusions prevalent in
the dataset. This research not only highlights the advancements in vehicle color detection but
also underscores the potential for further refinement and application of these technologies
across multiple industries.
